    title: "Business Leader of the Week: Meet Amin Hassan Nasser, CEO of Aramco",

      "Amin Hassan Nasser's stint with Saudi Aramco started in 1982 as an engineer in the oil production department, following which he went on to work in the venture's drilling and reservoir wing",
    fulltext: `Saudi Aramco or the Saudi Arabian Oil Group, is a Saudi Arabian public company, whose operational expertise lies in the field of petroleum and natural gas. As of 2022, the venture holds the rank of the world&#39;s second-largest company by revenue, as it has dominated media headlines by repeatedly achieving the largest annual profits in global corporate history.

    Saudi Aramco has both the world&#39;s second-largest proven crude oil reserves, at over 270 billion barrels (43 billion cubic metres) and the largest daily oil production tally among all oil-producing companies.

    Saudi Aramco, established in 1933, is currently operating the world&#39;s largest single hydrocarbon network, the Master Gas System (which came online in 1982 to transport associated gas from the Ghawar oil field to support the Kingdom&#39;s industrialization). In 2013, Aramco&#39;s total crude oil production reached the tally of 3.4 billion barrels, and in 2022, the venture was producing 13.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (mmboed), including 11.5 million barrels per day (mmbpd) of total liquids, from its over 100 oil and gas fields in Saudi Arabia, including 288.4 trillion standard cubic feet (scf) of natural gas reserves.

    As per the stats, between 1998 and 2021, Saudi Arabia saw its oil production volume increase by 2.6 million barrels per day, and peaked at 12.4 million barrels per day in 2016. Aramco was the guiding force behind these efforts.

    Two of Saudi Aramco&#39;s most prominent oil fields are located in the Kingdom&#39;s eastern part, in the form of the Ghawar (world&#39;s largest onshore oil field) and the Safaniya (world&#39;s largest offshore oil field).

    On 11 December 2019, Aramco made its debut at the Saudi Tadawul stock exchange. During the initial moments, the shares rose to 35.2 Saudi riyals, thus giving it a market capitalisation of about USD 1.88 trillion, while surpassing the USD 2 trillion mark on the second day of trading.

    In the 2023 Forbes Global 2000, Saudi Aramco was ranked as the world&#39;s second-largest public company.

    The guiding force behind Aramco&#39;s steady market rise is its 65-year-old President and CEO Amin Hassan Nasser, who took up the leadership role on a permanent basis in September 2015.

    Who Is Amin Hassan Nasser?
    Born in 1958, Amin Hassan Nasser has a Bachelor&#39;s degree in petroleum engineering from the King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals in Dhahran

    His leadership also saw Aramco facing drone and missile attacks on its facilities in September 2019. Yemeni Houthis were behind the incident, which led to two of Aramco&#39;s eastern facilities facing repair-like situations, cutting Saudi&#39;s oil production by about half, thus leading to the destabilization of global financial markets
    Amin Hassan Nasser also led the company&#39;s entry into the global debt and capital markets with its first bond issuance
    He oversaw Aramco&#39;s 2019 IPO in which it became the world&#39;s most valuable listed company, and resulted in its acquisition of Saudi petrochemicals giant SABIC in 2020

    Amin Hassan Nasser&#39;s View On Saudi-China Future Ties

    “Saudi Aramco aims to play a key role at the heart of China&#39;s long-term energy security and high-quality development,” Amin Hassan Nasser remarked during the China Development Forum in Beijing, which happened in March 2023.

    Saudi Aramco will reportedly expand its oil production capacity to 13 million barrels per day by 2027 while increasing gas production by over 50% by 2030 to fuel China&#39;s energy security.

    “We are also working on solutions such as advanced carbon capture and storage (CCS) and circular carbon economy technologies. Furthermore, we recently launched a USD 1.5 billion venture capital sustainability fund to invest in advanced technologies to help us move closer to a net-zero emissions future,” he said.

    “We want to be an all-inclusive source of energy and chemicals for China&#39;s long-term energy security and China&#39;s high-quality development. That is why we are doubling down on China&#39;s energy supply, including new lower carbon products, chemicals and advanced materials, all supported by emissions reduction technologies,” Amin Hassan Nasser concluded.`,

    title: "Fake customer service agents, “Fox8” botnets: Scammers run riot on X",
    description: "X&#39;s terms and conditions do not state whether subscriber accounts are pre-vetted",
    fulltext: `Consumers complaining of poor customer service on X (rebranded Twitter) are being targeted by scammers after the Elon Musk-led micro-blogging platform changed its account verification process.

    Bank customers and airline passengers are among those being exposed to the risk of suffering due to phishing scams as these individuals complain to companies via X, stated a Guardian report, while adding that the fraudsters, masquerading as customer service agents, are responding under fake X handles and trick victims into disclosing their bank details to get a promised refund.

    “They (fraudsters) typically win the trust of victims by displaying the blue checkmark icon, which until this year denoted accounts that had been officially verified by X,” the report explained the phenomenon.

    “Changes introduced this year allow the icon to be bought by anyone who pays an 11 pounds monthly fee for the site&#39;s subscription service, renamed this month from Twitter Blue to X Premium. Businesses that pay 950 pounds a month receive a gold tick. X&#39;s terms and conditions do not state whether subscriber accounts are pre-vetted,” the report remarked further.

    Guardian contacted an individual named Andrew Thomas, who was contacted by a scam account after posting a complaint to the travel platform Booking.com.

    “I&#39;d been trying since April to get a refund after our holiday flights were cancelled and finally resorted to X,” he told the media outlet.

    “I received a response asking me to follow them, and DM [direct message] them with a contact number. They then called me via WhatsApp asking for my reference number so they could investigate. Later they called back to say that I would be refunded via their payment partner for which I&#39;d need to download an app,” the person added further.

    “It looked like the real thing, but I noticed that there was an unexpected hyphen in the Twitter handle and that it had only joined X in July 2023,” Thomas said, as he became suspicious and checked the X profile of the &#39;travel platform&#39;.

    “I then checked the WhatsApp caller ID and found it was a Kenyan number. I&#39;ve since come across other fake Booking.com Twitter accounts which are following customers who are at their wits&#39; end trying to get a refund and have resorted to X to air their grievance with the company,” he narrated further.

    Booking.com has now reportedly refunded Thomas after the incident caught media attention.

    In June 2023, passengers suffering from easyJet and British Airways flight cancellations were targeted by cybercriminals using fake profiles after they resorted to X to demand refunds.

    Both the airlines informed the Observer about reporting the accounts to X. BA has even a pinned tweet alerting users to fake accounts.

    Not only the tourism industry, but even bank customers in the United Kingdom have now reportedly been warned to be vigilant as scammers are on the lookout for tweets that they can exploit to obtain personal account details.

    Lisa Webb, a consumer law expert at the campaign organisation Which?, blamed the recent changes to X&#39;s verification processes, which she believed, had made it harder for users to identify trusted accounts.

    “Complaining to a company on social media can be an effective tactic to get a quick response, but check to make sure this is coming from its official account and, if in doubt, get in touch with the company directly using the contact details on their official website,” she said, while urging the Rishi Sunak government to pass the online safety bill on an immediate priority basis and ensure “it delivers meaningful protections for consumers against a flood of online fraud infiltrating the world&#39;s biggest social media sites and search engines”.

    Threat Actors Running Riot On X

    As per the recent study by researchers from Indiana University, around 1,140 AI-powered accounts have been identified on X, which the research team has named the “Fox8” botnet. These accounts are reportedly using technology like ChatGPT to create fake content and steal pictures to create fake profiles.

    As per the New York Post, these bot accounts are aiming to trick people into investing in fake cryptocurrencies. The Indiana University researchers even suspect that the bots might have stolen from real crypto wallets, while using hashtags like #bitcoin and #crypto and interacting with real human-run accounts focusing on crypto news.

    The Fox8 botnet accounts are also spreading misinformation on various topics, including health and politics.

    The bots are using the tactics of flooding the micro-blogging platform with numerous AI-generated posts, to increase the chances of these &#39;posts&#39; being seen by real X users and ultimately, increasing the likelihood of someone clicking on harmful links.

    These bots are not only using stolen photos but are also interacting with each other and have a certain number of followers and friends. The Indiana University researchers further noted that these accounts have improved in their believability due to advancements in language models like ChatGPT.`,

    description:
      "The endless power wrangling of TV drama Succession, which satirises billion-dollar dynasties, certainly makes for compelling viewing. But real-life negotiations for ownership and control often requires cooler heads",
    fulltext: `The final season of HBO&#39;s hit show Succession captivated audiences across the world this year. Each week, millions around the globe tuned in to catch up on the latest backstabbing and in-fighting among the Roy siblings &ndash; the super-rich heirs to a media empire and one of the most deeply dysfunctional families on TV. The Roys&#39; machiavellian scheming and power-hungry plotting kept audiences hooked over the course of the show&#39;s four-season run. But, while the cut-throat world of Succession certainly draws on real-life influences at times, the reality of managing leadership change is thankfully far more civilised &ndash; even if it does pose its own challenges.

    In my own experience, the negotiations resulting in my being named CEO of the family business &ndash; Premier Dental &ndash; were among the most difficult processes of my professional life. These negotiations saw my father relinquish his role as CEO and owner and move into a new status as chairman of the board. At this time, decisions had to be made that many family businesses find themselves wrestling with at some time &ndash; issues such as how ownership shares will be divvied up among various members of the family, how those shares will be paid for or otherwise transferred from one owner to another, how important decisions about the business will be made, and how long the transition from one generation to the next will take, and more. With this experience of succession planning under my belt, there are five essential tips I would offer any family business looking to navigate a change in leadership and governance.

    Legal representation: The business will employ a law firm to manage the entire process &ndash; but you should also engage a lawyer to advise you personally and to represent your individual interests. This is a family affair, but what&#39;s best for you and what&#39;s best for other members of the family may not always be perfectly aligned. When all parties have advice and representation to defend their interests, then the chances for creating a plan that is fair to everyone are greatly enhanced.

    Respectfulness: Avoid taking the Roy family approach. Foul-mouthed insults and scathing jibes are not what is needed, here. Be respectful of everyone involved in the process, difficult as this may be at times. Big decisions about the future of a family business involve money, power, prestige and pride &ndash; all matters that generate strong emotional reactions. No matter how much all the family members love one another, the discussions are likely to become contentious. Work hard to avoid saying or doing things that you may later regret or that may end up burning bridges among family members. If you keep your head, even when others may lose theirs, in the end you&#39;ll be glad you did. Trust me, I&#39;ve been &#39;headless&#39; myself &ndash; it&#39;s not cute.
    Communication: Again, this is where Succession teaches us what not to do. The lack of communication between the extended Roy family is simply staggering &ndash; and by leaving so much unsaid, they so often find themselves in tight spots that could have been avoided. Remember that you can only get what you ask for &ndash; so don&#39;t assume the other members of the family, or the professional advisors and representatives involved in the process, understand what you need, want and value. Speak clearly about what matters to you and about the kind of arrangements that you consider fair and beneficial to the business &ndash; and when necessary, repeat yourself until you are sure you have been heard.

    Use data: As with any negotiating process, you will achieve more if you know as much as you can. This means understanding the family, its philosophies and preferences; the strengths, weaknesses, and needs of the business as it faces a challenging future; the kinds of arrangements that other families have made when faced with similar business issues; and so on. If you do your homework and shape your ideas according to what you learn, you&#39;ll be more likely to end up with an agreement that allows for a solid future.

    Plan for the non-end: Although it&#39;s difficult, you need to balance current interests with the needs of future generations. Strive to leave them a business and a dynamic that will raise as few questions and difficulties as possible.

    Managing change at the top
    On a personal level, addressing these issues required some challenging conversations with my father, which were complicated by our unique relationship and his approach to business. At times, when my father and I were at odds, he would vaguely suggest that he might want to reconsider things we&#39;d already settled, making the whole process very stressful for me. The months of negotiations embroiled me in a period of pain and frustration more intense than any other I&#39;ve experienced. In the end, though, our disagreements on ownership and control were resolved amicably and, I believe, for the good of the business. But if anyone ever tells you that dealing with a family business and its culture is easy, don&#39;t believe them.`,

      "According to Nielsen data, the high volume of viewing overall increased streaming's proportion of TV to 38.7%, setting a new record",
    fulltext: `According to a new survey, modern OTT platforms have defeated traditional TV as streaming accounted for a record 38.7% of all TV viewing in July 2023, with bought titles exceeding new originals in the United States.
    
    According to Nielsen data, the high volume of viewing overall increased streaming&#39;s proportion of TV to 38.7%, setting a new record. Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, and YouTube all reached record highs.
    
    At 20% of TV viewing for the month, total broadcast viewing was down 3.6% overall, setting a record low. The use of broadcasts decreased by 5.4% on a yearly basis, the survey found.

    In July, cable viewership declined as well, dropping a full percentage point to 29.6% of all TV viewing.

    Less than 50% of all TV viewing today comes through linear TV.

    According to the survey, “watching among those under the age of 18 grew 4%, and viewing among individuals 18 and over declined 0.3%, even if overall TV consumption was up just slightly from June (0.2%).”

    These developments led to a rise in streaming and “other” consumption, especially because of gaming consoles.

    Comparatively, sports on broadcast generated about 25 billion viewing minutes in July in the US, despite airing on numerous channels.

    Fall&#39;s arrival will probably bring a change in TV viewing habits, especially with the start of a new NFL season.

    For instance, sports accounted for 150 billion viewing minutes on broadcast in November 2022.

    According to the research, “Broadcast and cable may face a unique position this fall with the prospect for less fresh original primetime material, but the recent success of purchased programming on streaming channels underscores the outsized strength of exceptional content, regardless of when it was made.”

    “Linear TV [is] past the point of no return,” Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen wrote in a note to clients, adding that the revenue line for cable and satellite operators is “probably permanently negative” as pricing fails to drive upside while TV advertising growth stalls.”

    “We think the metrics for linear TV are all bad. Ad revenue across our media network coverage fell 13% on average in Q2, down from -8% in 1Q, which included the Super Bowl. We forecast the second half of the year will get slightly better, but to remain negative including an off-political year comparison,” the analyst added further.

    The Nielsen report comes amid more consumers dropping their cable packages in a trend known as “cord-cutting” and instead opting for streaming services that are deemed to be traditionally less profitable for media companies.

    “Still, streaming is not exactly outperforming either,” Nollen warned, as he stated that subscriber numbers at major direct-to-consumer services (DTC) including Peacock, Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+, Paramount+, Max and Discovery+ were down by about 500,000 combined.

    “Global DTC subscriber growth was 8.5% year-over-year (YoY), slowing to single digits for the first time,” the analyst wrote further, while adding that the growth was aided by Netflix&#39;s password-sharing crackdown, which helped the leading video streamer add 5.9 million subscribers in the second quarter.`,

    description:
      "In August 2023, the New Development Bank reportedly issued both R1 billion five-year bond and R500 million three-year note, as the auction attracted R2.67 billion in bids",
    fulltext: `The Shanghai-based New Development Bank (NDB), formed by BRICS countries in 2014, has conducted its first sale of bonds denominated in South African currency Rand, amid the background of emerging markets seeking greater access to local currency funding.

    In August 2023, the NDB reportedly issued both R1 billion (USD 53.1 million) five-year bond and R500 million three-year note, as the auction attracted R2.67 billion in bids.

    Former Brazil President Dilma Rousseff, who now chairs the NDB, informed the media that the bank was expecting to lend up to USD 10 billion by 2023-end to member countries, with about 30% of funds being lent in local currencies.

    These developments come amid the BRICS countries looking at ways to reduce their dependence on the US dollar and the US-dominated financial system.

    Kumeshen Naidoo, head of debt capital markets at Absa Group in Johannesburg, told African Business that the NDB&#39;s rand bond offerings were a significant development as the move could help lessen South Africa&#39;s dependence on volatile international capital markets.

    “The NDB already has a portfolio of rand assets &ndash; they have lent rand for South African social and infrastructure projects before &ndash; but they managed to fund that through the international swap and basis markets,” the official said.

    “This means they had to convert dollar funding that they raised through their Eurobond sales into rand. In the long run, the cost of that financing is dependent on the volatility of these capital markets &ndash; and international swap markets can be quite volatile,” he added further, while stating that the bond sales demonstrated that the NDB now has access “to a more sustainable, more domestic source of rand funding.”

    He also observed that these rand bond offerings could boost the development and sophistication of South Africa&#39;s capital market infrastructure in the long run, which has reportedly declined in recent years due to the nation&#39;s worsening domestic economy.

    “Similar types of entities [to the NDB] have issued bonds in South Africa before but those transactions have now matured &ndash; it&#39;s now been a long time since the likes of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), for example, have accessed the rand markets,” remarked Naidoo.

    “What we&#39;ve seen in the South African markets, certainly over the last three or four years, as the South African macroeconomic situation has deteriorated somewhat, is that South African issuers either have had no need for financing or have simply rolled their exposure,” he noted further.

    “As a result, some of the larger issuers that used to be active in the South African market either decreased their number of issuances or delisted programmes completely,” the official explained, while expressing confidence that having a new issuer in the form of the New Development Bank could help stimulate greater activity in South African capital markets.

    NDB&#39;s credit rating is reportedly significantly higher (AA+ from S&P and AA from Fitch) in South African markets and Naidoo believed that the entry of higher quality bonds into the country could help “drive up quality across the board”.

    “It&#39;s a really high-quality credit issuer, and will really set the benchmark, not just in terms of pricing, but certainly in terms of process,” he said, while adding that the NDB move could help drive greater interest in the South African market from international organisations in general.

    “Since the NDB announcement, we&#39;ve already received quite a few inbounds from similar entities asking for more guidance around process and information on how the NDB transaction worked,” Naidoo told African Business.

    “We think off the back of this, we will see more entities accessing South African debt capital markets &ndash; which will be great for investors, ensure a more sustainable source of rand funding for projects in South Africa, and overall will bring broader benefits for the South African people,” he concluded.`,

    Be it budget maintenance, keeping a tab over even minute spending, paying bills automatically, hassle-free payments overseas, getting 24/7 bank assistance, name any customer concerns, the Starling Bank app is there to address them.

    Starling&#39;s award-winning, app-based current account ensures that customers don&#39;t need to pay monthly fees, while applying in minutes for the service from one&#39;s smartphone.

    Starling&#39;s digital bank account feature, which acts as the virtual branch on your smartphone, also comes with categorised spending insights, which helps to keep a tab over your spending and monthly/yearly budget.

    A Brit can put his/her money aside in Starling&#39;s &#39;Virtual Change Jars&#39;, which automatically round up transactions to save the change and give someone a &#39;Connected Card&#39; if the person is spending the cash on the customer&#39;s behalf.

    Connecting with financial products mortgage, insurance or pension can also be performed through Starling&#39;s virtual marketplace. Also through a payment link, a Starling customer can send his/her money to nearby customers of the same bank, apart from splitting the bills with a smartphone tap.

    “Move all your finances over to Starling in a few taps by using the Current Account Switch Service. Lock your card with a tap. Use the app to lock your card if it goes missing &ndash; and block gambling transactions and payment methods, too. No fees overseas. Use both your card and ATMs freely when you travel, with no extra charges from us. All your admin, is in the app. Change your address, cancel your card, set up new accounts and more,” Starling stated.

    Apart from pulling off international money transfers with no hidden fees, the customer can also control his/her banking overdraft and cheque deposits from the app itself.

    Joint account holders can also set up &#39;Bills Manager&#39; from their online accounts.

    “Money for your bills will automatically be set aside &ndash; and paid &ndash; from a separate Space,” Starling commented further.

    Also, Starling customers can hold, send and receive euros for free with the bank&#39;s euro account feature. These individuals will get the current exchange rate with a 0.4% conversion fee added on top to cover their foreign transaction costs, apart from paying zero commissions and other hidden charges.

    Customers can transfer money between their UK and Europe accounts on a 24/7 basis. The solution also provides the live exchange rate before the cash conversion is made, so the customers can wait for their ideal exchange rate before proceeding with the overseas money transfer. The whole function can be performed through a single virtual debit card and the customer doesn&#39;t need to pay interest on his/her euro balance.

    And last but not least, you have &#39;Starling Kite&#39; and &#39;Teen Account&#39;, where British parents can imbibe the art of saving money for their offspring from the tender age of six, through virtual debit cards and online savings accounts.

    Solutions For Businesses Too

    You can apply for a free digital business account within the &#39;Starling&#39; app and get the formality done at quick notice. Some 500,000 British businesses are reportedly using Starling&#39;s digital business accounts.

    The easy-to-use business account comes with powerful money management tools, apart from presenting a fully regulated UK bank account, where these businesses&#39; money will be covered up to 85,000 pounds under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. All these services are free.

    The business account can be customised further with the business toolkit, euro and US dollar-based transaction features. Generating and evaluating invoices, tax assessment, submitting VAT returns, exchanging and holding euros and dollars, everything can be performed online.

    Breaking down monthly spending, sorting them across various categories, arranging files and payment receipts in order, setting a separate space for tax commitments, integrating with accounting tools, and depositing cash and cheques are some of the headaches business leaders face, and Starling Bank&#39;s digital solutions are tailor-made to solve these roadblocks.

    An Extensive Money Transfer Network

    Starling claims of its exchange rates and fees, when it comes to overseas money transfers, are some of the best on the market.

    “It&#39;s fast. Our standard send is usually speedy &ndash; but if you&#39;re in a hurry, you can opt to make a direct SWIFT bank-to-bank transfer (for a slightly higher fee),” it claimed further.

    Starling Bank customers can send money to 36 countries in 20 currencies. They can also opt to make a direct bank-to-bank payment with SWIFT instead, for a flat delivery fee of 5.50 pounds.

    “Send your payment via a local partner, for some currencies, it can take a little longer, but prices start at just 30 pounds per transfer. We&#39;ll guarantee your exchange rate for 30 seconds, which means you&#39;ll get the exchange rate you&#39;ve been quoted, even if it changes. It&#39;s only fair,” Starling Bank explained further.

    The Road Ahead

    Ariane Vickman has become Starling&#39;s new head of public affairs. Vickman has a proven banking background, apart from being the former senior parliamentary assistant in the office of Conservative MP and former United Kingdom deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab.

    Also, taking its vigilance game to the next level, Starling has chosen Napier, a London-based intelligent compliance technology firm, for the bank&#39;s Anti-Money Laundering and counter-terrorism financing commitments.`,
