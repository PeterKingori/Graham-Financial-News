                        <p class="section-question">What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of
                            structure did you choose to implement?</p>
                        <p class="section-answer">I have an interest in finance and business and I am a huge fan of the
                            TV show Gilmore Girls. I decided to design a
                            website based on these two interests. In Gilmore Girls, the Stars Hollow Gazette is a local
                            newspaper in the Stars
                            Hollow town . The paper has a print edition but has no online presence. I decided to create
                            a financial news website for
                            a fictional finance club in Stars Hollow that caters to people interested in international
                            finance and business.</p>
                        <p class="section-answer">The essential story being told by the website is to present finance
                            and business news that is updated daily. This is in
                            contrast to a print magazine that might only be printed once a week or less regularly and
                            isn&#39;t suitable for this kind
                            of information. The news articles consist of stories written by the editorial team as well
                            as those pulled from an api
                            that enriches and widens the scope of information that can be presented to readers. Each
                            article on the home page can be
                            opened in a separate page to be read in full. Readers can also contribute their own stories
                            through a form on the
                            Contribute page. The website also includes an online store element whereby readers can buy
                            special editions of magazines
                            or other material that the team might think would be beneficial.</p>
                        <p class="section-answer">I chose to implement a webbed model for the website, which has a
                            net-like structure. The homepage is connected to the
                            other pages through internal links which are shown on the navigation bar and the footer. The
                            navigation bar and footer
                            are present on all pages. The other pages in my website are the About, Contribute, Shop and
                            an article page that opens
                            when an individual article in the home page is clicked on. Since each page is available at
                            all times, visitors can
                            access all other pages from the page they are currently on. This structure is duplicated on
                            the footer which can also be
                            used to move to any other page on the website. The structure looks as follows:</p>

                        <ol class="section-answer answer-list">
                            <li>I used a font that is accessible to all users. I had used a serif font called Libre
                                Baskerville which has pronounced
                                tails. I realised that this would reduce the accessibility for readers with visual
                                impairment, so I changed all the text
                                to use a sans serif font called Montserrat.</li>
                            <li>I ensured that there is adequate contrast between the content and background to make
                                sure the website is still usable by
                                readers with visual impairment and is also readable outside in sunlight. I checked the
                                contrast using the developer
                                tools on Google Chrome to make sure it was right. Information is thus communicated
                                effectively to a user and it remains
                                legible.</li>
                            <li>I used semantic markup such as header, nav, footer, main and section in the HTML files
                                which is useful for people that
                                use screen readers. I made sure to use “alt” text in the image tag that will be shown if
                                the image can&#39;t be displayed
                                and is also read out aloud by screen readers. In the Contribute page there is a form
                                with text inputs which have the
                                label HTML element for accessibility as well.</li>
                        </ol>

                    <h3 class="heading">Usability</h3>
                    <div class="section-content">
                        <p class="section-question">State 3 ways in which you considered the usability of your site.</p>
                        <ol class="section-answer answer-list">
                            <li>I made the site responsive using media queries so that it could be viewed on a mobile
                                phone or tablet size device and
                                produce the same experience as that on a laptop. This way there is flexibility in use.
                            </li>
                            <li>I tried to keep the design simple and intuitive to use, regardless of a user&#39;s
                                experience. The navigation bar doesn&#39;t
                                have a lot of options that could overwhelm a user and it sticks to the top when the page
                                is scrolled so that other pages
                                in the website are always accessible even if a user has scrolled to the bottom. There is
                                plenty of whitespace around the
                                elements of a page and paragraphs of text. This way the content doesn&#39;t appear
                                crammed
                                and a user is comfortable going
                                through the site and reading the material without getting overwhelmed. I also didn&#39;t
                                use
                                a lot of colours and the ones I
                                used contrast well with each other.</li>
                            <li>I used a webbed model for the site structure. In this model the home page is connected
                                to other pages through internal
                                links. These links are the same in the navigation bar and footer so a user can locate
                                information that they need. I also
                                used page names that accurately describe the content within them. The goal of this was
                                so that the website can be used
                                comfortably without getting fatigued.</li>

                            did you achieve that?</p>
                        <ol class="section-answer answer-list">
                            <li>I had to learn how to use CSS and JavaScript to create a responsive and sticky
                                navigation bar. For the sticky part, when
                                a user scrolls down the navigation bar doesn&#39;t disappear from view and this makes it
                                easier for a user to navigate to
                                another page even if they have scrolled to the end of the current page without having to
                                scroll back up. This improves
                                the usability. For the responsive part, when the website is being viewed on a mobile
                                phone, the navigation menu is
                                hidden from view and only appears when a user clicks on the hamburger menu at the top
                                right. The menu is also presented
                                in full screen to make it easier to select an option.</li>
                            <li>I had to learn how to use JavaScript to present array data by accessing the DOM and
                                looping through the data while
                                creating HTML elements that would present the data. This was a better alternative to
                                presenting all the data using just
                                HTML since this would be repetitive, and it wouldn&#39;t be efficient for large data
                                sets. I
                                used this technique to present
                                sample articles in the carousel slider at the top of the home page, the first four
                                articles in the technology and
                                banking and finance sections, and the list of most popular news. This technique also
                                enables reusability of code since I
                                was able to use the same code to present the list of most popular news in the article
                                page when a sample article is
                                clicked on to be read. I also had to learn how to use JavaScript to fetch data from an
                                api and present it using this
                                same technique.</li>
                            <li>I had to learn how to implement the functionality of a shopping cart for my shop page
                                using JavaScript. I was able to
                                get it to add and remove items but there is a lot of functionality that is missing and a
                                bug that I haven&#39;t been able to
                                solve.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p class="section-answer">To achieve the above, I used Google to search for solutions, then I
                            read a few articles and answers on Stack Overflow
                            until I found solutions that I understood and was confident I could implement. However, I
                            found that the solutions
                            weren&#39;t being applied to situations and data exactly like mine so I had to adapt and
                            combine
                            different elements from
                            various solutions to come up with solutions that worked for the data I had.

                            For the shopping cart I found a YouTube video that explained it better than reading
                            articles. I had already started
                            working on it using the technique for adding article posts so I just had to add a few new
                            elements.</p>

                            Why?</p>
                        <ol class="section-answer answer-list">
                            <li>Using JavaScript to loop through the sample articles I have saved as an array in a
                                separate file, as well as those being
                                fetched from an api instead of hard coding each one in HTML. This made the work easier,
                                more efficient and reusable for
                                larger data sets. I used similar techniques to display the products on the shop page. I
                                also think the shopping cart was successful
                                although it needs to be completed to get full functionality.</li>
                            <li>I think the simplicity of the design and layout makes the website comfortable to use and
                                doesn&#39;t lead to fatigue. I&#39;m
                                also glad with how the responsive design turned out because this means that more people
                                can access the website and find
                                it useful. It was also good practice for future projects to be able to achieve that
                                design.</li>
                            <li>Making the website responsive in tablet and mobile size devices was also successful.
                                This makes it accessible to more people.</li>

                        <p class="section-question">What aspects of your work could be improved? How might you do things
                            differently
                            another time?</p>
                        <ol class="section-answer answer-list">
                            <li>The loading speed can be improved. On Google Chrome, I went to the developer options and
                                used the Lighthouse feature to
                                check the loading speed. I realised that it was being affected by the fonts I wanted to
                                use, the images and the
                                JavaScript files. So, I reduced the number of fonts and using advice from lighthouse I
                                learnt that I can use a “preload”
                                attribute in the links loading the fonts. I also reduced the size of images I used by
                                resizing them. Another time I
                                would try to further improve the performance by optimising the images before loading and
                                loading the JavaScript files in
                                a way that it doesn&#39;t interfere with the HTML but this could be challenging since
                                the
                                JavaScript dynamically adds the
                                content. I would do more research on how to optimise adding dynamic content using
                                JavaScript. This could also be an issue with the internet connection.</li>
                            <li>Another thing that can be improved is the layout and design of the news posts on the
                                home page. I think there are more
                                appealing layouts that a better designer than me can come up with. This also applies to
                                the other pages. Another time,
                                if possible, I would seek the help of a designer to come up with better designs and
                                layouts. This also includes the
                                fonts to use and which ones pair well together without affecting the accessibility.</li>
                            <li>The shopping cart in the Shop page doesn&#39;t have full functionality. There is also a
                                bug
                                when items are removed from the
                                cart that causes one extra item to be shown as remaining in the cart even if it is
                                empty. Another time I would plan my
                                time well so that I have time to fully implement the features I want and to have time to
                                do proper research and testing
                                to fix bugs.</li>
                            <li>Right now the API key I use to access the news is very exposed. I tried a number of ways
                                to hide it while still
                                retaining functionality but they didn&#39;t work. This can definitely be improved
                                because it
                                is a security risk. Another
                                time I think I will ask for help from a senior developer or lecturer at university if I
                                can&#39;t find a solution by myself
                                or if it takes too much time.</li>
                            <li>The CSS can also be improved to use more reusable CSS classes for elements like
                                headings, sections, images and so on
                                that can be applied across the whole site. I tried to do this but it still needs
                                improvement. There are also newer ways
                                that have been added to CSS such as using variables and I would research on using these
                                another time.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p class="section-answer">For all the above points I think for another time I would plan my time
                            better so that I can research well and have time
                            to learn new things. I would also seek help from an online tutor or senior developer.</p>
